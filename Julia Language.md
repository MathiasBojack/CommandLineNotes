# Basics



```
    # print
    println("blabla")  
    
    # Only last result of Multi line execution will be shown
    # Use ; to hide the result
    1 + 2   # enter to switch to the next line
    3 + 4   # shift + enter to execute
 Out: 7
    # No need to define the variable type when assigning variables
    # Julia will figure out types for us
```
